Hi, I’m Humberto. I’m a PhD student in the LIVE (Vehicular Innovation and Smart Cities) lab, @ Centro de Informática (Informatics Center) from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) :brazil:. I'm also a CS Professor at the Federal Institute of Pernambuco <a href='[https://portal.cin.ufpe.br](https://portal.ifpe.edu.br/garanhuns/)/'>IFPE</a>.

My main research areas include Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates, Vehicle Diagnostics, and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). I'm being advised by Prof. <a href='[[https://portal.cin.ufpe.br](https://portal.ifpe.edu.br/garanhuns/)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/staff/?alias=agsf)/'>Abel Guilhermino</a> focusing on the security aspects of ECU firmware updates using the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol.

Previously, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from the University of Pernambuco (UPE) in Computer Engineering. As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to work at the Systems Engineering Lab, dealing with the communication aspects of UAVs simulated using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework and swarm intelligence mechanisms.
