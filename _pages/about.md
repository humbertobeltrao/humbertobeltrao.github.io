Hi, I’m Humberto. I’m a PhD student in the LIVE (Vehicular Innovation and Smart Cities) lab, @ Centro de Informática (Informatics Center) from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) :brazil:. I'm also a CS Professor at the Federal Institute of Pernambuco (<a href='https://portal.ifpe.edu.br/garanhuns/'>IFPE</a>).

My main research areas include Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates, Vehicle Diagnostics, and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). I'm being advised by Prof. <a href='https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/staff/?alias=agsf/'>Abel Guilhermino</a>, focusing on the security aspects of ECU firmware updates using the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol.
